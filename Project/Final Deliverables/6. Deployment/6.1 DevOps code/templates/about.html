        <h2><b>NATURAL DISASTERS</b></h2><br>
        <p>A natural disaster is characterized by the abnormal intensity of a natural agent (flood, mudslide, earthquake, avalanche, drought) when the usual measures to be taken to prevent this damage were not able to prevent their emergence or were not able to be taken.Natural Disasters are catastrophic events that result from any of the Earth's natural phenomena. These can range from floods and hurricanes to tsunamis and earthquakes.The Earth, over its 4.54 billion-year history, has seen many natural disasters. Some of these disasters have led to several mass extinctions and drastic repercussions for various surviving species.
        </small></p>
        <p>A natural disaster can be defined as:“A major event brought about by the natural processes of the Earth that causes widespread destruction to the environment and loss of life.”A natural hazard often precedes a natural disaster.</small></p>

                  <p class="card-text"><br>Cyclones are caused by atmospheric disturbances around a low-pressure area distinguished by swift and often disruptive air circulation. The word cyclone is derived from the Greek word Cyclos meaning the coils of a snake and it was coined by Henry Piddington. <br><br>
                    In meteorology, the term cyclone is defined as :<br><i> " A system of winds that are rotating inwards to an area of low barometric pressure, such that in the Northern Hemisphere it is anticlockwise and in the Southern Hemisphere it is clockwise circulation."</i><br><br>
                    Cyclones are formed with an enormous amount of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere. According to studies, every year there are 70 to 90 cyclonic systems developed across the globe. The surface winds get spiralled towards the low-pressure system due to the Coriolis force. The cyclonic systems are not formed in the equatorial regions because the Coriolis force is negligible between the latitudes 5 degrees north and 5 degrees south.</small></p>

                  <p class="card-text">A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are an area of study in the discipline of hydrology. They are the most common and widespread natural severe weather event.A flood happens when water overflows or soaks land that is normally dry.<br><br> There are few places on Earth where people don't need to be concerned about flooding. 
                    Generally, floods take hours or even days to develop, giving residents time to prepare or evacuate. Sometimes, floods develop quickly and with little warning.
                    <br><br>A flood can develop in a many ways. The most common is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. These floods are called riverine floods. Heavy rain, a broken dam or levee, rapid icemelt in the mountains, or even a beaver dam in a vulnerable spot can overwhelm a river and send it spreading over nearby land. The land surrounding a river is called a flood plain.
                    Coastal flooding, also called estuarine flooding, happens when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to rush inland.
                    <br><br>Floods are the second-most widespread natural disaster on Earth, after wildfires. All 50 of the United States are vulnerable to flooding.</small></p>

                  <p class="card-text">An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides</small></p>
